# FarmTech Solutions

This project is a farm management application developed for FarmTech Solutions to assist a client in transitioning to Digital Agriculture. The application consists of a Python program for data management and R scripts for statistical analysis and weather data retrieval.

## Features

1. Support for multiple crop types (defined in crop_inputs.json)
2. Calculation of planting area for each crop
3. Flexible input management allowing users to specify quantities for all available inputs
4. Calculation of total amount of each product needed for each crop
5. Data organization using JSON and CSV formats
6. Menu-driven interface for data entry, display, updating, and deletion
7. Export functionality to CSV for further analysis
8. Import functionality from CSV to load previously saved data
9. Basic statistical analysis using R (mean and standard deviation)
10. Weather data retrieval using R (no API key required)

## Project Structure

- `farm_management.py`: Python script for data management (fully documented)
- `statistical_analysis.R`: R script for basic statistical analysis (fully documented)
- `weather_data.R`: R script for retrieving current weather data (fully documented)
- `crop_inputs.json`: JSON file containing crop types and their available input options
- `crop_data.csv`: CSV file generated by the Python script, containing entered crop data
- `input_management_doc.md`: Documentation for input management references
- `README.md`: This file, containing project overview and usage instructions

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- R 

### Running the Farm Management Application

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory.

2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python3 farm_management.py
   ```

3. Use the menu to interact with the application:
   - Enter crop data
   - Display entered crop data
   - Update existing crop data
   - Delete crop data
   - Export data to CSV
   - Import data from CSV
   - Exit the program

### Running the Statistical Analysis

After entering and exporting data using the farm management application, run the R script for statistical analysis:
   ```bash
   Rscript statistical_analysis.R
   ```

### Retrieving Weather Data

To get current weather information:

1. Run the R script:
   ```bash
   Rscript weather_data.R
   ```

2. When prompted, enter the name of the city for which you want to check the weather.

3. The script will display current weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

## Output

- The Python script (`farm_management.py`) generates a `crop_data.csv` file with the entered crop data.
- The statistical analysis R script (`statistical_analysis.R`) provides basic statistical measures in the console.
- The weather data R script (`weather_data.R`) displays current weather information for a specified city in the console.

## Documentation

All main scripts (farm_management.py, statistical_analysis.R, and weather_data.R) are fully documented with function descriptions and usage instructions. For detailed information on how each script works, please refer to the comments within each file.

## Note

This project is part of a FIAP Academic assignment. 

The application is a simplified model and may require further development for real-world use. Always ensure to enter multiple data points for meaningful statistical analysis.

For any issues or questions, please refer to the individual script files or contact Gabriel Mule <gabemule@gmail.com>.
